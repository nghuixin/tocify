## [Distributed fMRI Patterns Coupled to Low-Frequency Cardiorespiratory Dynamics Provide Markers of Aging](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/46/6/e1231252026?rss=1)
*J Neurosci*  
Score: **0.90**  
Published: 2026-02-11T17:30:25+00:00

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>How aging affects brain&ndash;body connections can be investigated through changes in the coupling between functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals and bodily autonomic processes across the adult lifespan. Recent studies using univariate approaches have identified age-related changes in the association between fMRI signals from multiple individual brain regions and low-frequency respiratory and cardiac activity. Here, we investigate if whole-brain spatial fMRI patterns associated …

## [Cognitive rejuvenation through partial reprogramming of engram cells](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00925-0?rss=yes)
*Neuron*  
Score: **0.90**  
Published: 2026-02-10T00:00:00+00:00
Tags: brain aging, rejuvenation, neuroplasticity

The paper focuses on rejuvenating brain functions through molecular and cellular methods, linking directly to brain aging. Innovative computational methods may be implied in linking molecular changes to observed cognitive improvements.

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Berdugo-Vega et al. combine partial reprogramming and engram technologies to achieve molecular rejuvenation of learning-associated neuronal ensembles. Engram reprogramming counteracts molecular, cellular, and electrophysiological signs of aging and disease and is associated with behavioral improvements that are consistent with a rejuvenation of learning and memory capacities.

## [In vivo aberration measurement and correction for ultrafast FACED two-photon fluorescence microscopy of the brain](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.06.704504v1?rss=1)
*bioRxiv*  
Score: **0.70**  
Published: 2026-02-10T00:00:00+00:00
Tags: MRI, neuroimaging, computational imaging

Focus on advanced imaging techniques could aid in high-resolution neuroimaging, potentially benefiting brain age modeling through improved data acquisition.

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Ultrafast two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2PFM) based on free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay (FACED) enables megahertz line scanning and kilohertz frame rates for in vivo brain imaging. However, optical aberrations from the imaging system and brain tissue degrade spatial resolution, signal, and contrast at depth. Here we integrate adaptive optics (AO) with FACED 2PFM to achieve synapse-resolving ultrafast imaging in the living mouse brain. Because FACED generates a one-dimensional array …

## [High spatial resolution 23Na-MRI for ischemic brain injury detection](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.05.703829v1?rss=1)
*bioRxiv*  
Score: **0.60**  
Published: 2026-02-10T00:00:00+00:00
Tags: MRI, neuroimaging, biomarkers

While more focused on injury, the development of high-resolution imaging techniques like 23Na-MRI could contribute to neuroimaging biomarkers in aging research.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

High spatial resolution sodium (23Na) imaging of brain lesions remains challenging due to the intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 23Na-MRI compared with conventional proton (1H) MRI. In this study, we established a high-resolution 23Na-MRI platform based on 14 T preclinical scanner using a dual-tuned head-implanted RF coil. This configuration enables the acquisition of 1H-based T2-weighted anatomical and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), as well as 23Na-MRI, from the same animal. Br…

## [Aberrant Medial Prefrontal Cortex Activity and Flexible Behavior in the TgF344-AD Rat Model of Alzheimers Disease](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/46/6/e1387252026?rss=1)
*J Neurosci*  
Score: **0.50**  
Published: 2026-02-11T17:30:25+00:00
Tags: Alzheimer's, aging, neuroimaging

While primarily focused on Alzheimer's, it uses an age-dependent rat model which might relate to brain aging trajectories, though it's less centered on neuroimaging or modeling methodologies.

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>Executive dysfunction can precede the accumulation of canonical neuropathological markers and severe dementia in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) patients often characterized by memory changes. Deficits in executive function including flexible behavior, i.e., the ability to shift behavior following negative consequences, are often mediated by the prefrontal cortex. However, it is unknown how medial prefrontal cortex activity is altered in behaving Tg-F344-AD rats, which exhibit age-dependent AD…

## [AI System Using Unsupervised Learning to Discover Novel Subtypes in Alzheimer's Disease](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.08.704669v1?rss=1)
*bioRxiv*  
Score: **0.40**  
Published: 2026-02-10T00:00:00+00:00
Tags: MRI, machine learning

The paper utilizes unsupervised machine learning with structural MRI data, a method relevant for computational insights into brain aging, though it focuses more on Alzheimer's phenotypes without explicit mention of brain-age models.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Early Alzheimer's disease often evades timely detection because typical diagnostics are based on symptomatic thinking rather than intrinsic neurodegeneration. Here, we use unsupervised machine learning to identify latent Alzheimer's phenotypes from structural MRI-derived volumetric features and neuropsychological scores, without using diagnosis labels or predefined subtype definitions. We analyzed participants (18-96 years) from the OASIS-1 study using intracranial, normalized, global, and regio…
