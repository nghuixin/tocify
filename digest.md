# Weekly ToC Digest (week of 2026-02-16)

This week's RSS feed does not contain relevant items directly related to brain aging, brain-age modeling, or neuroimaging biomarkers of aging. Most entries are either unrelated or focus on different biological or clinical contexts. Emphasize data science, brain-age models, and neuroimaging biomarkers for brain aging among the items reviewed. No RSS items were directly relevant to brain-aging or brain-age modeling, emphasizing neuroimaging or computational aspects. Several papers from diverse fields were observed, but none matched the specific focus criteria. No items this week closely match the user's interests in brain age modeling, computational methods, or neuroimaging biomarkers related to brain aging.

Aging affects cerebellar structure, yet the regional specificity of this decline and its relationship to sensorimotor function remain unclear. In this study, we quantified age-related gray matter differences in 50 young and 80 older adults using both anatomically defined cerebellar lobular parcellations and a function-based cerebellar atlas. Across both anatomical and functional parcellations, older adults showed robust reductions in gray matter volume relative to young adults. However, contrary…

## [BLIMPS: a technique for tandem biosensor imaging across multiple populations of presynaptic terminals, using lattice light sheet microscopy.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.12.705649v1?rss=1)
*bioRxiv*  
Score: **0.60**  
Published: 2026-02-15T00:00:00+00:00
Tags: neuroimaging, biomarkers, multimodal

Presents a potential neuroimaging method that could be applicable in studying brain aging processes.

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Within neuronal circuits, ordered neurotransmission is contingent upon balance between excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic signaling. To study circuit-level processes, the paradigm of 4D cellular physiology has been developed, where, single cells and subcellular structures are studied as individual units in three-dimensional space over a continuous interval rather than as a single moment in time, or as a population-level average. Neurons are excitable cells expressing voltage-gated…

## [Microbiome depletion rejuvenates the aging brain](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.13.705770v1?rss=1)
*bioRxiv*  
Score: **0.50**  
Published: 2026-02-15T00:00:00+00:00
Tags: aging, neurodegeneration, biomarker

Explores a novel approach that could affect brain aging mechanisms, but lacks direct computational methods focus.

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Aging is associated with cognitive decline and increased vulnerability to neurodegeneration driven by an array of molecular and cellular changes like impaired vascular integrity, demyelination, reduced neurogenesis, and chronic inflammation. Recent studies implicate the gut microbiome as a modulator of brain aging, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that depleting the gut microbiome by administering antibiotics to aged mice induces widespread molecular and structural rej…
