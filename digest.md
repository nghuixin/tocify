<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) contains rich individual, cognitive, and pathological information, yet no universal model exists for multi-task modeling of these dimensions. Here, we introduce MAMBAxBrain, a multi-task neural framework that integrates Mamba architecture with functional connectivity analysis to jointly model the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of neural activity. MAMBAxBrain achieves high accuracy across four distinct fMRI objectives - brain fingerprinting…

## [Cognitive rejuvenation through partial reprogramming of engram cells](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00925-0?rss=yes)
*Neuron*  
Score: **0.70**  
Published: 2026-02-10T00:00:00+00:00
Tags: brain age, neurobiology

This paper involves partial reprogramming techniques that counteract aging in neuronal cells, which may relate to the mechanistic underpinnings of brain aging, although it lacks specific computational methods.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Berdugo-Vega et al. combine partial reprogramming and engram technologies to achieve molecular rejuvenation of learning-associated neuronal ensembles. Engram reprogramming counteracts molecular, cellular, and electrophysiological signs of aging and disease and is associated with behavioral improvements that are consistent with a rejuvenation of learning and memory capacities.

## [AI System Using Unsupervised Learning to Discover Novel Subtypes in Alzheimer's Disease](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.08.704669v1?rss=1)
*bioRxiv*  
Score: **0.65**

Tags: machine learning, Alzheimer's, MRI

Utilizes machine learning to identify Alzheimer's subtypes, relevant to brain aging and neuroimaging. Highlights computational methods.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Early Alzheimer's disease often evades timely detection because typical diagnostics are based on symptomatic thinking rather than intrinsic neurodegeneration. Here, we use unsupervised machine learning to identify latent Alzheimer's phenotypes from structural MRI-derived volumetric features and neuropsychological scores, without using diagnosis labels or predefined subtype definitions. We analyzed participants (18-96 years) from the OASIS-1 study using intracranial, normalized, global, and regio…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

High spatial resolution sodium (23Na) imaging of brain lesions remains challenging due to the intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 23Na-MRI compared with conventional proton (1H) MRI. In this study, we established a high-resolution 23Na-MRI platform based on 14 T preclinical scanner using a dual-tuned head-implanted RF coil. This configuration enables the acquisition of 1H-based T2-weighted anatomical and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), as well as 23Na-MRI, from the same animal. Br…

Neuroimaging research has produced tens-of-thousands of articles that pair natural language and activation coordinate tables. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have provided methods to model text and images simultaneously. In this work, we present NeuroVLM, a model architecture for learning from 30,000 human neuroimage-text pairs. The architecture supports contrastive and generative objectives. The contrastive model ranks similarity between neuroimages and text. The generative mod…
