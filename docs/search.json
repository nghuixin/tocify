    "text": "narrative\nI’m primarily interested in computational methods and applied machine learning for brain aging, especially brain age prediction and brain-age gap (Brain-PAD) models using neuroimaging (MRI/DTI/fMRI, multimodal) and, secondarily, EEG-derived aging markers. I am also generally interested in papers that introduce or benchmark robust, generalizable pipelines. This includes calibration/age-bias correction, normative modeling, and uncertainty quantification/interpretability."

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have provided methods to model text and images simultaneously. In this work, we present NeuroVLM, a model architecture for learning from 30,000 human neuroimage-text pairs. The architecture supports contrastive and generative objectives. The contrastive model ranks similarity between neuroimages and text. The generative mod…"
